Few things frustrate me more than people who don’t communicate consistently or effectively in a professional setting. When you’re working on a group project—especially one with multiple stakeholders—every participant benefits from a shared understanding of the project’s current status.

This doesn’t mean everyone needs to know every detail. But if you complete something that might impact others, it helps to communicate that progress. Keeping everyone on the same page prevents potential conflicts, ensures that parts of the project integrate smoothly, and allows each person to adapt as needed.

### Communicating Progress and Delays

Proactive communication is especially important when things aren’t going perfectly. If there’s a deadline—even a soft one—and you might not meet it, let your team know. Some people hesitate to communicate potential delays because they worry about looking unprepared. But honestly, sharing early about possible missed deadlines or delays builds respect and helps others plan accordingly.

For instance, if a part of a project requires another person’s work to be complete first, knowing that their timeline might shift allows others to adjust their priorities rather than waiting and losing momentum. Proactive updates help the entire team stay agile and efficient.

### Asking for Help and Avoiding Prolonged Blocks

When working through challenges, it’s always wise to try solving issues independently first. But if you’re still stuck after a reasonable effort—say, an hour—and believe a teammate might have a solution, reaching out can prevent prolonged blocks. I’d bet a million dollars that any collaborator would rather spend a little extra time helping someone get unblocked than find out at the last minute that key work was delayed because someone didn’t ask for help.

When asking for assistance, be clear and thorough. Share not only what the problem is but also the high-level goal and what you’ve tried. This way, you avoid redundancy and help teammates understand the full context before jumping in.

### Avoiding the “Game of Telephone” in Team Communication
On many teams, messages often get distorted, like in a game of telephone, as they pass through different people. Essential details and intentions can warp, especially when feedback is relayed indirectly. To avoid this, if you have feedback to share with a teammate, deliver it yourself—directly and clearly.

Positive feedback is most impactful when it comes directly from you. When you give compliments face-to-face, it builds rapport and feels authentic; compliments that come through intermediaries lose impact. Constructive feedback is also best shared directly. Delivering it in person shows respect for your teammate, preserves your message’s clarity, and prevents misinterpretation. By avoiding intermediaries, you prevent involving teammates who don’t need to be part of the conversation and avoid inflating the significance of your critique.

Communication isn’t always straightforward, and sometimes you might receive feedback that feels out of place or misaligned with the person giving it. In these cases:

- **Pause Before Reacting**: Don’t jump to conclusions about feedback, even if it seems out of place coming from a particular person.
- **Clarify the Source of Feedback**: When relaying feedback, be clear about its origin. Phrasing feedback like “The director suggested…” or “This is my idea” prevents miscommunication and frustration.

In teams built on respect, everyone should feel comfortable giving and receiving feedback. With direct, clear communication, each person can be confident that their messages are understood and received as intended.

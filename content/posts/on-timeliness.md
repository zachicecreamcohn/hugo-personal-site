Timeliness is critical, especially when it affects others. To me, being on time is a sign of respect and professionalism. I try to live by the mantra: “Early is on time, on time is late, and late is unacceptable.” Here's why.

First, arriving early gives you a buffer for the inevitable things that might go wrong. Maybe you have trouble finding parking, maybe you get the location wrong—whatever the issue, being early builds in time to handle these situations without making you late.

Second, arriving early ensures that you’re genuinely ready when the start time arrives. If something starts at 7:00 PM and you arrive at 6:45, you have time to settle in and mentally prepare. Jumping straight into a task or meeting the second you arrive is difficult; there’s usually a bit of chitchat or setup beforehand. That extra 10-15 minutes can be the difference between starting on time or delaying everyone.

Finally, being early shows respect for everyone else’s time. Most people have packed schedules with multiple commitments throughout the day. If someone has back-to-back meetings or appointments, your being even a few minutes late can create a cascade of problems, making them late for their next commitment. Showing up early acknowledges that everyone has other things going on and respects their schedules.

Showing up unnecessarily late sends a message: “I expect everyone to work around my poor planning.” It’s as if you’re saying, “I know you wanted this meeting to begin on time, but my schedule is more important.” Consistently showing up late gives the impression that you’re disorganized and unprofessional. Conversely, being habitually on time builds respect and reliability.

Being on time—preferably a little early—is one of the simplest and most effective ways to demonstrate respect, organization, and professionalism. If you care about others, and if you value your own reputation, follow the mantra: “Early is on time, on time is late, and late is unacceptable.” Try arriving 10 minutes early to everything—you will feel the difference, and so will everyone else.
